**1 Project Title**
RatioDrive: A database for a ride sharing service

**2 Project Description**
A database designed for the purpose of effectively managing a carpooling service’s operations, theMySQL
database includes vital information for drivers, users, and the business. The system tracks the user’s journey
history with information such as dates, places, distance, length, fares, and ratings for the driver. It also
keeps track of user information, contact information, and emergency contacts. Driving licenses, national
identification numbers, automobile ownership, and login histories and emergency contacts are also stored so
that the app can ensure the highest degree of security for its users, guaranteeing that all activities pertaining
to them are recorded and monitored. The information of all the cars, including model, registration number,
year of manufacture, and odometer readings, as well as crucial papers like tax and fitness expiration dates,
are also managed the database. The system also keeps track of revenue information, including commissions,
payment methods, earnings from each trip, and other financial transactions. The system improves the
capacity of the carpooling service to effectively manage drivers, passengers, and vehicles by centralizing
and organizing all of this data. It also provides clear reporting on trip activity, financial performance, and
fleet management. The project architecture prioritizes efficient and simple querying of all private user and
financial data, while providing a convenient way for drivers and users to track journeys, book rides, and leave
reviews. The end goal is to enable an application that offers a productive and safe platformfor overseeing the
whole carpooling ecosystem, enhancing financial control, operational transparency, and user experience.

**3 Project Objective**
The objectives of this projects are:
• Ensure Rider and Driver Safety: The system will maintain detailed and accurate records of all users
and drivers, including all sorts of identification documents and emergency contacts.
• Efficient Financial Tracking: The system tracks payment methods, trip fares, driver earnings, and
commissions. Bymaintaining transparent and organized financial records and graphs, it will create an
easy to use and understand interface for the users.
• Optimize Vehicle and StaffManagement: The platformmanages vehicle details such as registration
numbers, model, maintenance records, and expiration dates of documents. It also includes staff or
admin portals to assign roles, monitor activities to keep the user safe.
• Enhance Operational Efficiency: By integrating functionalities such as ride scheduling, user management,
financial reporting, vehicle tracking into one single app, it smooths out the difficulty of a user in
going from point A to point B
• Ensure Data Privacy and Security: Data privacy is a core priority. However these concerns will not be
handled by the database and will be handled in the app building stage.
• Promote Sustainable Transportation and Community Engagement: By encouraging ride-sharing,
the platform supports environmental sustainability and reduces traffic congestion. It also fosters a
sense of community as people interact with each other as they go from place to place.
• Apply Database and Software Development Principles: This project demonstrates the effective use of
database development conventions and technology and how it scales to the real world.
